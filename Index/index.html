<h3>Posting in the wrong place</h3>
<p>You ae not to post the same thread twice, be it in the same section
 or in two seperate sections. Of course we understand that you can 
 accidentally hit the submit button twice, but posting a topic a second 
 time just to give i more attenion will result in one of the topics 
 being deleted or locked dependent on the situation. If one of the topics
 has already received helpful replies, the other topic will be locked,
 linkingb to the topic that will remain open. Accidental doule posts will
 be deleted without any further consequences for the user.</p>
 
 <p>This alsao goes for posting postgs in the wrong topics. Posts topics
 and posts in the correct place. This means questions about PHP go in
 in the PHP forum, and not the PHP Tutorials section or Web Development
 section, for example.</p>
 
 <h3><a name="farm"></a>Post count farming</h3>
 <p>Sometimes people try to boost their post count artificially by
 posting short and/or useless messages. This is not to be done, and 
 we therefore don't allow people to post in forum games very quickly
 after each other. If you posted in one, don't respond to it again 
 for a certain amount of time.</p>
 
 <h3>CAPS etc.</h3>
 <p>We're a community, therefore wqe should be able to communicate 
 properly. So don't write posts with only caps, and try not to use
 shorthand words (so how r u today?) and things in similar vein.</p>
 
 <h3>Advertising</h3>
 <p>Advertising web sites or products that you are in some way
 affiliated is not allowed. This goes for any and all advertisements.
 Advertisements will be removed instantly, no exceptions.</p>
